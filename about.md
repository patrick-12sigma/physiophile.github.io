I am a physicist-turned research engineer and enthusiast in Deep Learning and I am passinate about harnessing the power of AI to better the world. 


### More about me

I earned my PhD in Physics from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. After working as a senior detector physicist at [PerkinElmer Medical Imaging](https://www.vareximaging.com/varex-imaging-acquires-perkinelmer-medical-imaging) and [Carl Zeiss AG](https://www.zeiss.com/semiconductor-manufacturing-technology/products-solutions/process-control-solutions.html), I am now working full time on deep learning as a research scientist at [12 Sigma Technologies](http://www.12sigma.cn/en/Products/diagnosis/), an AI start-up focused on medical image analysis and one pioneer of bringing deep learning to the front lines of healthcare. 

In my spare time, I am an avid learner of foreign languages. Please see [here](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~llgc/other_languages.html) for my self-introduction in different languages.
